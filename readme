Input data:
- Initial state
- Number of empty cells
- Weight of each tile

Output data:
- Number of intermediate states before reaching the goal state
- Sequence of intermediate states from the initial state to the goal state

State format:
- A list of $16-z$ unique integers represeting the location of each of the tiles in the grid, where $z$ is the number of empty cells. The integers range from 1 to 15, corresponding to the tile numbers. The empty cells are not represented in the list. 
- Cells are indexed from 0 to 15 in row-major order.

Goal state:
- The goal state is a state where the tiles are arranged in descending order from $16-z$ to 1, with the empty cells at the end of the list.
